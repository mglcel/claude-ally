# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
claude-ally - cli-tool using Shell scripting, Markdown, Git

## üö® MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS - NEVER SKIP THESE

### Core Development Rules
- Always commit changes once done
- Try to update documentation and README files when done
- Write tests for changes and eventually adapt existing ones
- When making changes ensure you check all implications/dependencies, analyze callers, documentation, signatures
- When using python, use venv
- Always run tests after a commit to ensure nothing is broken
- **üî• CRITICAL: MUST wait for GitHub Actions workflows to pass before considering work complete**
  - Never give up the prompt to user while GitHub Actions are failing
  - Continue debugging and fixing until ALL CI/CD workflows pass
  - Only consider development task finished when tests pass in CI environment
  - GitHub Actions success is mandatory for task completion

### Project-Specific Critical Assets
- Configuration files, environment variables: Enhanced protection protocols required
- Shell scripts: Framework-specific best practices enforcement
- Markdown documentation: Consistency and clarity standards
- Git operations: Repository integrity and history preservation

### 3. TECHNOLOGY STACK EXPERTISE

#### Shell Scripting Best Practices

- Quote variables properly: `"$variable"` not `$variable`
- Use `[[` instead of `[` for better functionality
- Implement proper argument validation
- Use functions for reusable code blocks
- Handle edge cases and error conditions

#### Markdown Standards

- Proper code block syntax highlighting
- Clear table formatting
- Consistent link formatting
- Proper list indentation and structure

#### Git Operations Safety
- Always check repository state before operations
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Validate branch operations
- Ensure clean working directory when needed
- Implement proper conflict resolution

### 4. CLI Tool Architecture Principles

#### User Experience Optimization

### 5. LEARNING ENHANCEMENT TRIGGERS

#### Continuous Improvement Protocol

**Learning_Signal_Detection**:
- When issues are caught that patterns missed ‚Üí HIGH confidence learning opportunity
- When optimizations are suggested ‚Üí MEDIUM confidence pattern enhancement
- When unexpected behavior occurs ‚Üí HIGH confidence gap identification
- When patterns successfully prevent problems ‚Üí HIGH confidence pattern validation

### 6. ERROR RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

#### Pattern Miss Detection

- "Are there shell scripting, git operations, or configuration problems not flagged?"

#### Secondary Validation Checks
**Security_Backstop**:
- Final scan for configuration files and environment variable security patterns
- Double-check that credential/secret patterns weren't missed
- Verify shell injection vulnerabilities are addressed

**Technical_Backstop**:
- Scan for setup complexity that might impact user experience
- Verify cross-platform compatibility wasn't overlooked
- Check for missing error handling or edge cases

#### Pattern Improvement Triggers
- "If setup complexity was missed, what pattern should have caught it?"
- "What keyword would have triggered proper cross-platform analysis?"
