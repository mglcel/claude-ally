**Automatically configure Claude with your project's tech stack for better, more relevant responses.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mglcel/claude-ally.git

# Go to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Set up Claude with your project context
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh setup
```

That's it! Claude will now understand your project structure and give more relevant advice.

## What It Does

**Before Claude-Ally:**
- "How do I add authentication?" → Generic authentication advice
- "What's the best way to structure this?" → Generic patterns

**After Claude-Ally:**
- "How do I add authentication?" → React + Node.js specific auth with JWT, proper error handling, and security best practices
- "What's the best way to structure this?" → Advice tailored to your exact tech stack

## How It Works

1. **Detects your tech stack** - Analyzes your project files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. **Creates a CLAUDE.md file** - Contains your project context and requirements
3. **Claude reads this context** - Gives responses specific to your setup

## Commands

```bash
claude-ally.sh setup      # Configure Claude for your project
claude-ally.sh detect     # See what tech stack was detected
claude-ally.sh analyze    # Comprehensive project analysis
claude-ally.sh contribute # Add your stack to the community
claude-ally.sh validate   # Validate system installation
claude-ally.sh help       # Show all commands
```

### New in v2.1
- **🔍 Project Analysis**: New `analyze` command provides comprehensive project insights
- **🚀 Enhanced Performance**: Consolidated utility modules (95% size reduction)
- **🧩 Modular Setup**: Split setup system into focused, maintainable modules
- **🔧 Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and progress indication
- **✅ Enhanced Testing**: 17 additional tests for new features

## Example

For a React + Node.js project, Claude will automatically know to:
- Suggest React hooks and component patterns
- Recommend Express middleware and error handling
- Include security considerations for web apps
- Use your specific database patterns

## Contributing

Found a missing tech stack? Run:
```bash
claude-ally.sh contribute
```

This analyzes your project and helps add it to the community stack library.

## Requirements

- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL)
- Git (for contributing new stacks)
- Claude CLI (optional, for automatic setup)
