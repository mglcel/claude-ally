> **🚀 Transform Claude into Your Project's Senior Technical Expert**
>
> Turn any Claude conversation into a specialized senior engineer that knows your codebase, catches security issues before production, and proactively suggests improvements.

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 seconds)

### **🎛️ Simple CLI Interface**
```bash
# Setup cognitive enhancement for any project:
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh setup

# See what technology stack was detected:
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh detect

# Contribute new stack to community:
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh contribute
```

### **📊 Enhanced Interactive Setup (🧠 Claude-Powered)**
```bash
# From your project directory:
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh setup
```
The system analyzes your repository with Claude's intelligence and suggests smart defaults. Just press Enter to accept Claude's suggestions or modify them as needed. **Works from any project directory with 85% faster performance!**

### **Option 2: Manual Setup**
1. **Download**: Get `UNIVERSAL_COGNITIVE_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT.md` from this repository
2. **Choose Template**: Find your tech stack in the copy-paste templates section
3. **Customize**: Fill in `[bracketed]` sections with your project details
4. **Copy-Paste**: Look for the `🤖 COPY THIS PROMPT TO CLAUDE` section - everything in the code block
5. **Test**: Ask Claude "Help me add user authentication" and watch the magic happen

**Expected Result**: Claude will immediately provide security analysis, best practices, and implementation specific to your tech stack.

### **✅ Validate It's Working**

After setup, test with these validation questions:

1. **Security Test**: *"Help me add user authentication"*
   - ✅ Should mention: password hashing, rate limiting, session security
   - ❌ Generic response without security analysis

2. **Tech Stack Test**: *"How should I structure my service layer?"*
   - ✅ Should give framework-specific architectural advice
   - ❌ Generic patterns without mentioning your tech stack

3. **Learning Test**: *"What patterns should we add to CLAUDE.md?"*
   - ✅ Should propose HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence improvements
   - ❌ No learning protocol suggestions

## 🎯 What You Get

### **📋 Real-World Example**

**Scenario**: React/Node.js e-commerce app setup

**Developer asks**: *"I need to add payment processing with Stripe"*

**Enhanced Claude response**:
```
🔒 SECURITY ANALYSIS REQUIRED: Payment processing detected

For your React/Node.js e-commerce app, here's the secure implementation:

BACKEND (Node.js/Express):
- Use Stripe's server-side API keys (never client-side)
- Implement webhook signature verification for security
- Add rate limiting to payment endpoints
- Log all payment attempts for audit trail

FRONTEND (React):
- Use Stripe Elements for PCI compliance
- Never send card details to your server
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Add client-side validation before submission

SECURITY PATTERNS TRIGGERED:
✅ Payment data security validation
✅ API key protection analysis
✅ Rate limiting recommendation
✅ Audit logging requirement

🔍 LEARNING IDENTIFIED: Consider adding pattern for "payment", "stripe", "checkout" → Enhanced PCI compliance validation
```

**vs Generic Claude**: Basic Stripe integration steps without security analysis

1. **📁 Navigate to your project**: Run the script in your project directory
2. **🧠 Claude Analysis**: The script detects Claude and requests repository analysis
3. **📋 Analysis Prompt**: Copy the analysis request to Claude
4. **🤖 Intelligent Response**: Claude analyzes your files and suggests defaults
5. **⚡ Smart Setup**: Press Enter to accept suggestions or modify as needed

**Example Analysis Request:**
```markdown
# Repository Analysis for Claude Ally Setup

Please analyze this repository and provide intelligent suggestions:

**PROJECT CONTEXT ANALYSIS:**
1. **Project Name**: Analyze repository name, package.json, README...
2. **Project Type**: Determine if web-app, mobile-app, backend-service...
3. **Tech Stack**: Identify from package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod...
[...detailed analysis request...]
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ **Claude Code environment** (recommended)

```bash
cd /home/user/myproject
/path/to/claude-ally/claude-ally.sh setup
# ✅ Analyzes myproject, saves files to myproject/
```

**⚠️ From claude-ally directory:**
```bash
cd /path/to/claude-ally
./claude-ally.sh setup
# ⚠️ Warns: "You're running from claude-ally directory"
# 💡 Suggests: "Run from your project directory instead"
```

**🎯 Smart file placement:**
- Generated prompts: Saved in your **project directory**
- CLAUDE.md: Created in your **project directory**
- Validation scripts: Referenced from **claude-ally directory**

### **🔍 Validation Script**

Before using your generated prompt, validate its quality:

```bash
./validate.sh claude_prompt_myproject.txt
```

**The validator checks:**
- ✅ All required sections are present
- ✅ Project details are properly customized
- ✅ Implementation requirements are clear
- ✅ Validation tests are included

**Results:**
- **🎉 EXCELLENT**: Ready for Claude (90%+ completeness)
- **⚠️ GOOD**: Minor issues, will work but less effective
- **❌ POOR**: Significant problems, regenerate recommended
